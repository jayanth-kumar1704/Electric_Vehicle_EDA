#Electric-vehicle---EDA
#This dataset focused on Electric Vehicles, applying various data analysis techniques to uncover fascinating trends and it conducted as part of my internship at Innomatics Research Labs. 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 1: 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: Explored electric vehicle ranges, uncovering a standardized range with a few outliers. This insight could guide manufacturers on battery capacity decisions. 𝐁𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: Studied the relationship between electric range and model year, revealing how BEVs outshine PHEVs in range and demonstrating technological evolution from 2000 to 2020.

#𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 2: Created an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly Express to visualize the geographical distribution of EVs across different regions. The power of data visualization never ceases to amaze. 𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Analyzed EV adoption trends across states and legislative districts. Certain areas are leading the charge in EV adoption, while others may benefit from infrastructure development.

#𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 3: 𝐕𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: Used boxplots to visualize how top vehicle manufacturers compare in terms of electric range, providing insights on areas for improvement. Designed a Racing Bar Plot showcasing the evolution of EV manufacturers over the years. This animation highlights the rise of key players in the electric vehicle market. !
